	<p> This is a website all about me, Zedekiah LuGrain (pronounced ZED-UH-KAI-UH if you were wondering), most people just call me "Zed" for short.
		I am 17 years old currently, and have various different facts about myself. With this website, I will give you some insight on who I am, and who I want to be.
		It contains a biography, my interests, my favorite videos, my favorite websites, and my future plans. Enjoy! </p>
