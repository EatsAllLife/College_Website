<p> My favorite websites are pretty generalistic for most people. I don't really do much online besides go onto some text-based games that play themselves practically. Along with go onto Facebook. Besides that, websites I visit are just casual and typically not a day-to-day thing. </p>

<h3> The websites I typically visit/use daily </h3>
<ul> 
	<li> <a href = "https://www.avabur.com/?ref=14443"> Relics of Avabur</a> which is an idle played text-based game. </li>
	<li> <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/">  <img src = "images/facebook.png" width = "50" height = "50" alt = "Facbook Logo"></a> Facebook </li>
	<li> <a href = "https://pendoria.net/game#"> Pendoria </a> another idle played text-based game. </li>
	<li> <a href = "https://www.pinterest.com/"> <img src = "images/pinterest.png" width = "50" height = "50" alt = "Pinterest Logo"></a> Pinterest is where I get some of my drawing ideas. </li>
