<p> For my future plans, I aim to be a computer programmer, or coder, for softwares and to be able to build games, websites, etc. to the best of my ability and to continue to advance what there is. I like the freedom, and possibility that comes with the coding, and by the time I am through with college I am sure there will be many more variances of things to do with all the code. I hope to know many languages, and not just a few of the "main" languages; such as C#, HTML, JavaScript, etc. </p>
<p> I haven't quite decided on where I am going to go to college quite yet, but for the next 2 years of highschool (including this one), I plan to take my classes through Hawkeye Community College as I am now. <br>
I am also unsure as to where I will end up, but likely in a state with a Google Headquarters, as my aunt currently works with Google, I could potentially begin an internship there while in college to begin my career launch. A lot of this stuff is still in the air until I decide on a college, and get accepted. I do plan to do most of my gen-ed's through community college, then later go to a different college for my major in programming. </p>
<p> As long as I get into programming though, I don't really care where I go, or where I end up. I just want to be able to do what I will love doing. Along with being able to get paid for that, it's a hard thing to find anymore- a job you enjoy and will pursue in for a long time, that will always need more people. </p>
