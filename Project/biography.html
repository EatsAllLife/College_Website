	<p> I am originally from Dubuque, Iowa. Dubuque is a great place to visit, but I wouldn't really advise living there. There are many different attractions and sites to see. 
	Such as the <a href = "https://www.cityofdubuque.org/706/Julien-Dubuque-Monument"> Julien Dubuque Monument </a>, the <a href = "https://www.cityofdubuque.org/712/Shot-Tower"> Shot Tower </a>, the <a href = "http://www.encyclopediadubuque.org/index.php?title=FOURTH_STREET_ELEVATOR"> 4th Street Elevator </a>, and many more!

	<p> I was born, and raised in Dubuque until I was about 10 years old, and lived with my dad after my parents had divorced when I was 7. I went to Prescott Elementary School, had and still have many of my friends from there. I moved to my mom's after getting bullied by a few people on my way home from school daily. I was in what they called "enrichment" but really it was just the TAG program with a different name. After moving with my mom to Clarksville, Iowa. Which, was a very big change going from the city of Dubuque, to the tiny mere miles town of Clarksville. 
	</p>
 <br>
	<p> Going through Clarksville schools was pretty easy, they were (and still are as far as I know) behind the curriculum of most other Iowa schools. I was also in the TAG program there from 5th grade up, until I moved. Though, Clarksville was easy while I was there, it set me back education-wise when I moved to Waverly in the 8th grade. I lived in Clarksville and made many friends and "enemies", along with getting into plenty of trouble, as most kids do. I lived there for about 4 years or so, then to Waverly. </p>
 <br>
	<p> After moving to Waverly I realized that I was able to keep up with most of the curriculum; English, Science, and History were all at about the same area, or at least understandable. But math on the other hand, I have been in accelerated math since 7th grade, so moving mid-year of Algebra I, Waverly was much farther ahead and I can guarantee I missed out on about of 1/2 of Algebra I's info. From there math has been a bit more of a struggle due to having to play catch-up once I moved. Other than that, I have everything else pretty set in this point of time. Plenty of friends, family, and support for everything I need. </p>

	<h1> Highschool </h1>
	<a href ="https://www.wsr.k12.ia.us/"> <img src = "images/WSR_highschool.jpg" width = "500" height = "284" style = "float:left; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" alt = "A picture of Waverly-Shell Rock Highschool"></a>
	<p> I started highschool at Waverly-Shell Rock Highschool not long after I moved to Waverly. I am the class of 2020, and am still currently enrolled in highschool. There is a lot left to do, and I am a junior this year. I don't play any sports, or do any extra-curriculars, that never really has been "my thing". I started working my sophomore year at Taco Johns, and worked there for about 6 months. Then Sasquatch Jack's opened, and I started to work there and quit at Taco John's. I am still currently working at Sasquatch Jack's, and have moved from where I started as a dishwasher at $7.25/hr, up to being a cook at $10.00/hr and I'm sure there are more raises to come! School goes well, but sometimes I do get an excess amount of homework and end up having to stay up practically all night in order to complete it on time, but I guess that is just a part of life now. I also started to take college classes my junior year- this being my first college class. I look forward to what's to come! </p>
